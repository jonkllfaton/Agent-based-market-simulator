## 🔥 Project Overview

**AI Agent-Based Market Simulator** is a **Python-powered simulation of a decentralized market**, where multiple **autonomous AI agents** interact, trade, and adapt strategies in real time.  

This simulator models **microeconomic behavior, market dynamics, and emergent patterns** using AI-driven decision-making for agents. It’s perfect for:  

- Testing **AI-based trading strategies**  
- Studying **market behavior and agent interactions**  
- Visualizing **supply-demand dynamics and price fluctuations**
