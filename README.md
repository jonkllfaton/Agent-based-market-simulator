## 🔥 Project Overview

**AI Agent-Based Market Simulator** is a **Python-powered decentralized market simulator**. Multiple autonomous AI agents interact, trade, and adapt strategies in real time.

The simulator models **microeconomic behavior, market dynamics, and emergent patterns** through AI-driven decision-making. It is ideal for:

* Testing **AI-based trading strategies**
* Studying **market behavior and agent interactions**
* Visualizing **supply-demand dynamics and price fluctuations**
